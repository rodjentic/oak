@dataclass
class Credential:
    """Container object that groups together all information related to a single
    credential while it passes through the oak-runner pipeline.

    The instance is created early by the credentials provider with a
    `id` and optional free-form `metadata`.  Subsequent pipeline stages
    (transform, validate, etc.) enrich the same instance in place instead of
    returning new structures, which keeps the data flow simple and avoids
    excessive object creation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id: str
        identifier for the credential (Not unique, may be the same for multiple credentials)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
        Arbitrary auxiliary data coming from the provider. Can include issuer
        information, requested scopes, location hints, etc.
    auth_value: AuthValue | None
        Normalised credential value as it appears in the OpenAPI document.
    request_auth_value: RequestAuthValue | None
        Credential value formatted for direct injection into an outgoing HTTP
        request (e.g., header, query param, cookie).
    security_scheme: SecurityScheme | None
        The OpenAPI `SecurityScheme` object that this credential fulfils.
